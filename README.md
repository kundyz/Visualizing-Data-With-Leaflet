Task
* Get your data set.
* Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
* Your visualization should look something like the map above.
* Make sure that the HTML on the page has your name somewhere.
* Plot a second data set on our map.
* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
* Add layer controls to our map.
